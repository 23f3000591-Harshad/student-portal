# Student Portal

This repository contains the front-end (HTML/CSS) for a responsive Student Portal, designed to be integrated with a Flask backend. The portal allows students to register, log in, and view their academic course details.

## Features

*   **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login functionalities.
*   **Course Overview**: Display of assigned courses, instructors, credits, and grades.
*   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Built with Flask & SQLite**: (Backend assumption based on prompt, though not provided in this file)

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend**:
    *   HTML5
    *   Tailwind CSS (for responsive and modern UI)
    *   JavaScript (for minimal interactive elements like mobile navigation)
*   **Backend (Conceptual)**:
    *   Flask (Python web framework)
    *   SQLite (Database for user and course data)
    *   Werkzeug (for password hashing - typically used by Flask-Login/Flask-Bcrypt)

## Setup (Backend - Conceptual, for a full Flask app)

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)

1.  **Clone the repository (if this were a full repo):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-portal.git
    cd student-portal
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Werkzeug
    # Or for a more complete app:
    # pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Login Flask-Bcrypt
    ```

5.  **Initialize Database (example if using Flask-SQLAlchemy):**
    You would typically have a `models.py` and a `run.py` or `app.py`.
    ```python
    # Example in app.py or a script
    # from app import db, create_app
    # app = create_app()
    # with app.app_context():
    #     db.create_all()
    ```
    This would create the `site.db` SQLite database based on your SQLAlchemy models.

6.  **Run the Flask Application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the application URL in your web browser.
2.  **Register**: Create a new student account using the registration form.
3.  **Login**: Access your dashboard using your registered credentials.
4.  **View Courses**: Once logged in, you can view your enrolled courses and associated details.
